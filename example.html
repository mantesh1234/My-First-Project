                A popular theory holds that Mardi Gras' origins lie in ancient pagan
                celebrations of spring and fertility, such as Saturnalia and Lupercalia. Some
                experts contend, however, that Mardi Gras-type festivities popped up solely as a
                result of the Catholic Church's discouragement of sex and meat during Lent.

                Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. Parade goers
                will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the
                crowds walk by between parades. ... On Mardi Gras day, the majority of
                non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.

                Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday," also called Shrove Tuesday. It is the
                day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the start of Christian Lent season leading
                up to Easter. During Lent, many Christians fast, and the name Fat Tuesday refers
                to the last day of eating richer foods before the leaner days of Lent begin.
