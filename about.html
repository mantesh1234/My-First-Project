        <h2>Our Current Mayor - LaToya Cantrell</h2>

        <p>
            LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
            Louisiana, a
            post
            she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman to hold the post. Before
            becoming
            mayor,
            Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012â€“2018.
            Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
            history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
            strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction
            Council
            tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected
            within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city
            infrastructure,
            public transportation, public parks, and green spaces.As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City
            of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufactures and distributors. <br><br>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
            what is
            now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it
            as
            part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New
            Orleans
            is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
            (including cross-dressing).In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of
            French
            descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. <br><br>

        </p><br>
        <h2>Traditional Colors</h2>
        <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The colors
            were
            first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in
            1872,
            suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were
            chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed
            to
            any true symbolism. <br><br>

        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Costumes and Masks</h2>
        <p>
            In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat
            Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's
            identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with
            security concerns (such as convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before
            entering.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Mardi Gras Traditions</h2>
        <h3>Social clubs</h3>
        <p>
            New Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration as hosts of many of the
            parades on
            or around Mardi Gras. The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades. Zulu is a
            mostly African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting in
            late
            January. At these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and
            21,
            not married and in high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present
            themselves
            and their court of maids (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small
            roles in the ball and parade, such as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room.
        </p><br><br>
        <h3>Rex</h3>
        <p>Rex was organized by New Orleans businessmen in part to put on a spectacle in honor of the New Orleans visit
            of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia (remembered locally as "Grand Duke Alexis") during the 1872
            Carnival season. Also in the minds of the founders of Rex was the desire to lure tourism and business to New
            Orleans in the years after the American Civil War.

            Rex has held more parades in New Orleans than any other parading organization. Its official song is "If Ever
            I Cease to Love", a quirky tune from the 1870s musical "Bluebeard". This was adopted because the Grand
            Duke Alexis of Russia had a fondness for the actress who sang the song in the musical, which was playing in
            New Orleans at the time of the first Rex parade in 1872. It has stuck around since then and is played often
            during Carnival.</p><br>

        <h3>New Orleans Zulu or Mardi Gras Coconut</h3>
        <p>One of the most famous and the most sought after throws, is the Zulu Coconut also known as the Golden Nugget
            and
            the Mardi Gras Coconut. The coconut is mentioned as far back as 1910, where they were given in a natural
            "hairy" state. The coconut was thrown as a cheap alternative, especially in 1910 when the bead throws were
            made
            of glass. Before the Krewe of Zulu threw coconuts, they threw walnuts that were painted gold. This is where
            the
            name "Golden Nugget" originally came from.</p> <br><br>
